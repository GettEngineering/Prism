# Prism

Prism is Gett's Design System code generator for Mobile apps.

It can take Zeplin projects as input, and generate iOS & Android code for the mobile clients, so they can communicate in the same language.
    
## Developing

Run `make project` to create an Xcode project and start working.
Run `make test` to run all tests.
Run `make clean` to clear any assets.
